#OpenSCAD Triangle Box

Parametric triangle box for your alien friend...

This box was made to learn to use a CNC machine. It is parametric, thus one can edit specific variables in case a iteration fails and has to be adjusted. 

Open the file `3dview.scad` to see the 3D model of the box. Use the file `projections.scad` if you want to export `.dxf` files for CNC machining.
